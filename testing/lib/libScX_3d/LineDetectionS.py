#A line detection implementation that auto-adjusts thresholds and sensitivities!

#Main line detection code:
#Arguments:
#src: The source image, can be in color if needed
#threshold: This is the master threshold, it controls the optimal number of lines detected
#cannyThreshold1: This is the starting Canny Threshold1, it is auto adjusted (You shouldn't touch this)
#cannyThreshold2: This is the starting Canny Threshold2, it is auto adjusted (You shouldn't touch this)
#houghLinesThreshold: This is the HoughLines Threshold, it is constant, change it if you want...
#startingSensitivity: This is the starting sensitivity, you shouldn't touch it... (It's also backwards)
