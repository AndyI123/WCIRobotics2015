###WELCOME!!

This is the official repository for WCI's 2015 robotics team.

This is all my code with a GUI wrapped around it for demoing it.

Just run nulldemo.py

Hint: Try running python with the "-B" parameter, this will prevent python from leaving stupid .pyc files everywhere... My scripts will not leave .pyc files because they have the ```sys.dont_write_bytecode = True``` in the nulldemo.py file so you don't have to worry :)
